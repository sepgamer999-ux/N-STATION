Important legal notes
---------------------
- The combined project is licensed under AGPLv3 (see LICENSE.txt). Any distribution
  of the project as a whole is therefore subject to AGPLv3 terms.
- The PS4 UI background is licensed under MIT (see LICENSE-MIT.txt). MIT permits
  inclusion within an AGPL project, provided the MIT copyright and license text
  remain present (which this project preserves).
- If any file is a mixture of AGPL and MIT code and cannot be separated, the
  practical effect is that the distributed combined work is governed by AGPLv3,
  while MIT copyright notices must still be preserved.
- If you intend to reuse third-party components from this repository in other projects,
  confirm the exact license for each component and follow its terms.
